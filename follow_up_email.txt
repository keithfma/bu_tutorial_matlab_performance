Hi everyone,

Thanks for coming to the tutorial on Wednesday. I am writing to point you towards the slides and example from class, and to make sure that you have contact information for me and the Research Computing Services team in case you need some help in the future. 

You can find the slides and worked example at the link below. The "Tuning MATLAB Codes For Better Performance" materials are the first item in the "High Performance Computing Tutorials" section.

As I mentioned in class, the most complete reference currently available for performance tuning in MATLAB is this textbook:
